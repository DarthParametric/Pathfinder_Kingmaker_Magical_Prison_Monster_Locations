# Pathfinder: Kingmaker Magical Prison Quest Monster Locations

This is a list of all the monsters you are required to kill, and where you can find them, in order to complete the Magical Prison quest. The list of required locations was derived from the [Magical Prison page on the Kingmaker Wiki](https://pathfinderkingmaker.gamepedia.com/Magical_Prison). The monster list was tabulated during the course of one of my own playthroughs of the game. 

After completing this list, the key item associated with the quest will show -1 charges. I'm not sure if that is intended, or if there is one spare. The quest description says you must kill 45 monsters, but in actuality what it means is you must visit 45 locations. A number of locations require multiple monsters to be killed rather than just one, and many other locations have additional mobs that aren't part of the quest but must be cleared to get to the target. You will know you have completed the requirement for a given location when you see a blue energy effect on the player character (this also runs contrary to the quest description, which intimates that the locations will be marked with a symbol).
